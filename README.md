# K_means_Clustering
This Notebook will attempt to group country happiness levels using the unsupervised machine learning algorithm k-means clustering. This is my first attempt to learn and implement the k-means clustering algorithm. I will be using the sklearn library and a collection of indicators from the World Bank open database.

The html file is a non-functional view of the Notebook that includes all script output.

This repository is open to anyone who wants to use it.
